- 👋 Hi, I’m @mimingcat
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things such as programming, website development, RC Drones, game development, anime and many more things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning website development from the ground up. So far I have learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript. Soon I'm planning to be more comfortable with javascript and move on to using js.framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a senior website developer who's been in the industry for a while not to mentor me and help me with my journey to becoming a website developer. I'm looking for any small collaboration for a beginner like me to help out.
- Contact me via email at kennethdel2425@gmail.com
